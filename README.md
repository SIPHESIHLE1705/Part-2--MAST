how the app works:
By letting users peruse a well crafted menu with a variety of meals, including appetizers, main courses, and desserts, the app offers a smooth eating experience. The Home Screen greets users, displays the total number of menu items, and allows them to scroll to view the entire menu. They are taken to the Course Selection Screen after they have selected a dish, where they can select the starter, main course, or dessert that goes with it. Following their pick, consumers are taken to the Summary Screen, where they can check their options before completing their order. This screen shows the dish name, description, selected course, and pricing. An eye-catching background image improves the user experience throughout the app, fostering a cozy and welcoming environment.
